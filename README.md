## Description:
The workshop was created by the University of Toronto's Data Science Institute. The beginning of the course will introduce basic Python syntax. Learners will then learn about data types, functions, and control flow.[...]

This course is designed for those who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career.

## Learning Outcomes
After successfully completing the course, the students will:
1. Undersand various Python data types and their role in coding.
2. Be able to design functions in Python following the Function Design Recipe.
3. Know how to test and debug their code.
4. Learn how to interact with databases via Python.
5. Be able to analyze a dataset in Jupyter Notebook with Numpy and Pandas.

## Design
The workshop consists of three classes a week for two weeks, or six classes total. Classes will run 6 PM -8 PM EDT on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 9 AM - 12 PM EDT on Saturdays. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one break during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.

## Expectations
The course is a live-coding class. Students are expected to follow along with the coding in their own Python notebooks.. Students should be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout. Although slides will be available for students to reference, they should be referenced before or after class, as class will be dedicated to coding with the instructor.
