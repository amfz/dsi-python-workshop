## Description:
The workshop was created by the University of Toronto's Data Science Institute. It is designed for those who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career.

This course starts with Python fundamentals, like data types, functions, conditionals and iteration. We then introduce modules, file input and output, and object oriented programming concepts, which sets the stage for working with data in files with the help of popular data science libraries. Learners will gain an understanding of common data science workflows in Python. 

## Learning Outcomes
After successfully completing the course, the students will:
1. Understand various Python data types and their role in coding.
2. Be able to design functions in Python following the Function Design Recipe.
3. Be able to control the execution flow of code through conditionals and loops.
4. Know how to test and debug their code.
5. Be able to load and analyze a dataset in Jupyter Notebook with `numpy` and `pandas`.
6. Be able to visualize data with popular visualization libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Design
The course runs synchronously over Zoom. It consists of three classes a week for two weeks, or six classes total. Classes are 6 PM - 8 PM EDT on Mondays and Thursdays, and 9 AM - 12 PM EDT on Saturdays. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one break during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.

## Expectations
The course is a live-coding class. Learners are expected to follow along with the coding in their own Python notebooks. Learners should be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout. Although slides will be available, they should be referenced before or after class, as class will be dedicated to coding with the instructor.

### Technology requirements
* **Learners must have an internet connection and a computer to participate in online activities**
* Learners must have one of the following:
  * a Google account that can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/); or
  * the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed on their computer

## Policies
* **Microphone**: Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking -- some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Camera**: Keeping your camera on is optional, but encouraged.
* **Course communications**: Communications take place over email. Please include "DSI-Python" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Python: pandas question"

## Schedule
*Schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.*

* Day 1: Introduction, setup, basic data types, variables, and operations
* Day 2: Functions, dealing with errors, documenting code, working with strings
* Day 3: Logic, control flow, collections of values
* Day 4: Modules, reading and writing files, object-oriented programming concepts
* Day 5: Working with data in `numpy` and `pandas`
* Day 6: Data visualization

## Folder Structure
* **01-slides**: Course slides as interactive Juptyer notebooks (.ipynb files)
* **original-slides**: Original course slide as interactive Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files)
* **data**: Datasets used in the course
